Create two branches of Surf and Paddle, one to convert your CSS to Sass and then one for your final Github Pages page.

First:
If you are still struggling with HTML/CSS please find Shane or myself this afternoon or hit us up on HipChat.
Continue to use the command line (Terminal) as much as possible during this assignment

In your Sass branch:
Set up a Sass file
Change any color used more than once into a Sass variable
Use at least one mixin
Include that mixin using a partial & import
Nest your Sass as much as possible

In your final gh-pages branch:
Push it live to Github Pages
Comment on the assignment page a link to that site

Bonus
Make all of your SCSS nested!
Also review Git Branching/Commiting by finishing - https://try.github.io
